### :construction_worker: **`Digital Data Craftsman`**  
`Data Engineering` | `Analytics and Visualization` | `Machine Learning`

As an engineer I design scalable data systems, transforming unstructured data 
into optimized pipelines, warehouses, and analytics-ready models. Using my knowlege
of machine learning, I am able to further enhance my data by helping create accurate
prediction models to give an additional layer of decision maker. All of the projects I
have undertake have a singular goal in mind - building ETL systems to ensure data quality
and proper data infrasture, as well as empowering people to make better decisions.

### :memo: What I am Currently Working on :memo:
**Projects**
  * :moneybag: Financial Institution :moneybag:
    
    *Background*: Currently in the planning phase of building a cloud-based data pipeline that a bank or financial institution may use in there daily operations.
    
    *Goals*:
      * Cloud-based (AWS)
      * Pull multiple different data sets from multiple locations (stocks, transactions, etc)
      * Have multiple different SQL Layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
    
**Certifications**
  * AWS Solutions Architect and Data Engineer Associate
    
    Currently preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect and Data Engineer Associate certifications. These certifications will deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure and scalable
    data engineering solutions, strengthening my ability to design and manage end-to-end data pipelines in cloud environments.
