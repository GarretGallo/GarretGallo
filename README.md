### :construction_worker: **`Digital Data Craftsman`**  
`Data Engineering` | `Analytics and Visualization` | `Cloud Engineering`

As an engineer I design scalable data systems, transforming unstructured data 
into optimized pipelines, warehouses, and analytics-ready models. By leveraging cloud 
technologies such as AWS, I am able to deliver scalable, production-ready data solutions 
that enhance performance, reliability, and maintainability. All of the projects I
have undertake have a singular goal in mind - building ETL systems to ensure data quality
and proper data infrasture, as well as empowering people to make better decisions.
