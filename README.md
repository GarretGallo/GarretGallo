`Data Engineering` | `Analytics and Visualization` | `Machine Learning`

As an engineer I design scalable data systems, transforming unstructured data 
into optimized pipelines, warehouses, and analytics-ready models. Using my knowlege
of machine learning, I am able to further enhance my data by helping create accurate
prediction models to give an additional layer of decision maker. All of the projects I
have undertake have a singular goal in mind - building ETL systems to ensure data quality
and proper data infrasture, as well as empowering people to make better decisions.

### :memo: Project Highlights :memo:
**VGC ETL Pipeline - An Analytical Deepdive**

  *Overview* : The goal of this project was to create a detail ....
  
  *Link to Repository*: https://github.com/GarretGallo/Pokemon_Stats

#

### :memo: What I am Currently Working on :memo:
**Projects**
  * :earth_americas: WorldWeatherAI :earth_asia:
    
    *Background*: Currently developing an ETL data engineering pipeline that extracts weather data from 10 different countries. Once the data is extracted, it is transformed into clean
    data that can be aggregated several ways to produce insightful and high level visualization. A machine learning model will then be training using this new cleaned data to accurately
    predict future weather events. The entire system is deployed to a web platform, enabling users to access reliable, real-time weather insights as well as historical
    weather events.
    
    *Future Goals*:
      * To scale this project to have hundreds of more locations
      * Automate the ETL, visualization and machine learning processes
    
**Certifications**
  * AWS Solutions Architect and Data Engineer Associate
    
    Currently preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect and Data Engineer Associate certifications. These certifications will deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure and scalable
    data engineering solutions, strengthening my ability to design and manage end-to-end data pipelines in cloud environments.
